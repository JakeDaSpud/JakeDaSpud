## 🟥(oﾟvﾟ)ノ Yo, I’m Jake O'Reilly 🥐
I'm an Irish college student studying Game Development. I make websites, games and programs.

## 🟧Interests 🗂
I like to create content and consume it too! Reading, games, art, researching! I also learn and speak multiple languages. I like researching accessibility in video game and software experiences.

## 🟨Study 📚
I’m currently learning a lot of things! I'm in a 4 year long Game Development course (BSc, NFQ 8), which goes over Game Theory, Blender/Animation, Maths/Games Physics and programming languages.

## 🟩Work 💾
I am making a portfolio site for myself, as well as other websites such as sharing my game dev journey!
