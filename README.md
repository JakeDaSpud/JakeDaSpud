## 🟥(oﾟvﾟ)ノ Yo, I’m Jake O'Reilly 🥐
I'm an Irish college student studying Game Development and improving my own programming skills too. I make websites, games, programs and try to keep them updated to my current level of skill.

## 🟧Interests 🗂
I like to create content and consume it too! Reading, games, art, hell, even researching! I also learn and speak multiple languages. I have an affinity towards researching how disabilities affect video game experiences.

## 🟨Study 📚
I’m currently learning a lot of things! I'm in a 4 year long Game Development course (BSc, NFQ 8), which goes over game theory, blender and animation, programming in Java, HTML/CSS/JS and C++, maths for programming, SQL for databases and workplace practices.

## 🟩Work 💾
I am making a portfolio site for myself, as well as other websites such as sharing my game dev journey and a companion blog to my book channel!
