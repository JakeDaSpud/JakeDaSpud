# (oﾟvﾟ)ノ Yo, I’m Jake O'Reilly 🥐
I'm an Irish college student studying Game Development. I make websites, games and programs.

## Interests 🛹
I have a wide range of hobbies: studying accessibility, languages, games. I am a pixel artist and do every OTHER type of art. I play guitar and am learning music theory!

## Study 📚
I’m always learning lots of things! I'm in a 4 year long Game Development course (BSc, NFQ 8) which has been much more compsci-based than I'd thought... it's still interesting! Just not very game-based...

## Work 💾
I make websites, videos, and blogs about my interests, and games in Godot and Unity!
