The player is walking around a kitchen with a fridge, table and chairs, pet food bowl and water bowl, plant stand, kettle, stove, sink, window, and drying rack. The UI has a day count and success/fail count in the top left, it says Day 3: Pass Fail Pass. The bottom right has a task list that looks like a sticky note with the texts: 'Tidy Bookshelf in Living Room', and 'Brew Tea in the Kitchen'. The bottom left has a Journal with a J on it. Above the player is a large red E to show the player that they can interact with the sink, which is highlighted blue. The window and table with chairs are both highlighted red which shows that the player has selected them as being suspected Anomalies."

						<!-- Description -->
						<p class="col-12 col-xl justified-text">Unity anomaly (spot-the-difference) horror game. Made during my Trier, Germany Erasmus semester in a team of 4, I did the music and programming. Has systems for managing when events can happen, which can overwrite others. Anomalies can be enemies or change other objects. Custom animations for player interactables. The main mechanic is the Highlight mode and checking if the player has selected the right items.</p>

					<p>I've always loved learning things, and that's one of the reasons I love game development. Games as a medium allow me to learn anything I want to, and still be relevant because I can put them into a project.</p>
					<p>Since 2020 I've played guitar and have quite a few by now, I used to take piano lessons but I never got into theory, although I still love sound technology and music.</p>
					<p>I love learning languages, I am native in English, I can barely speak Irish (but I want to re-learn it and study the culture more), I've taken Spanish for 8 years while casually speaking it, and I learned German when I lived there for 6 months, and have loved learning it since.</p>
					<p>I didn't try programming until I went to college, but I had always assumed I'd like it. I tried learning Python from a magazine before college, but it was explained terribly and I didn't even know what <code>for i in range(5)</code> was doing: where did <code>i</code> come from? WHAT IS <code>i</code>?? I understood everything from my first language's module: Java, a statically typed language (something I look for in all my languages now!).</p>
					<p>On the note of programming, I do like dabbling in lower-levels, 6502 Assembly up to C are interesting when looking at optimisation and learning how CPUs / Computers work, I also took a liking to Cryptography this way. Abstracting to human-readable code isn't that different from decrypting messages!</p>
					<p>My gaming taste has changed quite a bit over my life. I started as a PS3 trickshotter during my CoD:AW and BO3 days, but now I casually play Valorant with friends. I love RPGs like Fallout 4, Persona, Pokémon, Skyrim, Final Fantasy, but I seem to love buying games more than playing them... my backlog is ever-expanding! Terraria has always been in my life, from playing with my sister on the PS3 to this day, the rich building systems and items are what keep me playing!</p>
